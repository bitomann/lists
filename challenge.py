# Challenge: Iterating over planets

# 1. Create another list containing tuples. Each tuple will hold the name 
# of a spacecraft that we have launched, and the names of the planet(s) that 
# it has visited, or landed on.
# Example spacecraft list
spacecraft = [
   ("Cassini", "Saturn"), 
   ("Viking", "Mars"),
]
# 2. Iterate over your list of planets, and inside that loop, iterate over 
# the list of tuples. Print, for each planet, which satellites have visited it.
